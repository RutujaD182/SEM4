String Instruction Basics

    Source DS:SI, Destination ES:DI
        You must ensure DS and ES are correct
        You must ensure SI and DI are offsets into DS and ES respectively
    Direction Flag (0 = Up, 1 = Down)
        CLD - Increment addresses (left to right)
        STD - Decrement addresses (right to left)

The Direction Flag

    One of the control flags in the FLAGS register is the direction flag (DF)
    It determines the direction in which string operations will proceed
    The string operations are implemented by the two index registers SI and DI
    If DF = 0, SI and DI proceed in the direction of increasing memory addresses
    If DF = 1, they proceed in decreasing direction

CLD and STD

    To make DF = 0, use the cld instruction

cld     ;clear direction flag

    To make DF = 1, use the std instruction

std     ;set direction flag

    cld and std have no effect on the other flags
